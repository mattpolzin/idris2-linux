# idris2-linux: Utilities for using Idris2 on GNU/Linux systems

Although it says "GNU/Linux" in the title, a lot of the stuff in here
might also work on other (POSIX) systems. That stuff should eventually
go to some kind of idris2-posix library. But it is now too early for
that.

This library is new and experimental. Please come back later.
